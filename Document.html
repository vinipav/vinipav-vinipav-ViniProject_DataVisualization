	<h1>CHOLERA OUTBREAK- 1854 IN LONDON</h1>

	<div>
		<p>The purpose of the assignment was to recreate Dr. John Snow's cholera outbreak map as an interactive
			visualization using JavaScript and the Data Driven Documents (D3).</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>OBJECTIVE:</h3>
		<p>To recreate John Snow’s outbreak map using D3 JavaScript.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>REQUIREMENTS:</h3>
		<p>First, I have gone through the deliverables of my project and summarized the requirements.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A map to show </li>
			<li>A timeline graph which shows the number of deaths per day </li>
			<li>Ability to pan around the map, zoom in and out the map </li>
			<li>Interactive to users </li>
			<li>Show up whether each victim was a male or female on the map </li>
			<li>Show age of victim’s map of the area (streets and pumps) including the locations of the deaths </li>
			<li>Show the distribution of deaths by sex and age overall</li>
			<li>Well labeled map and graph </li>
			<li>Stable map and the graph </li>
			<li>Check visualization with a color blindness simulation tool </li>

		</ol>

		<h3>DESIGN PROCESS:</h3>
		<p>Based on the requirements I started to design my page. </p>
		<img src="img/img1.png" height="400" width="400" alt="">
		<img src="img/img2.png" height="400" width="400" alt="">
		<p>I have used all the datasets which are given for my project by the instructor. I have used different colors
			in the graph to differentiate the attributes. Black denotes male, orange is female, green is workhouse and
			pink is for Brewery. By moving the cursor to the black or orange dots on the map you can see the age group
			of the victim.
			<br>
			I have developed a timeline chart with the given dataset. From the timeline chart, we can see the epidemic
			has reached its peak on September 1st and afterwards it started reducing gradually.

	<div id="pg">

		<p>
			I have developed additional charts, age-based death chart and gender-based death chart. Age based death
			chart shows the age groups and number of deaths between the age groups. By moving the cursor over to the
			chart, you can see the number of deaths in the age groups. Also, I have shown the total number of deaths by
			gender. I have used two colors to differentiate male and female. I found that there is no significant
			difference in death rate between male and female.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>FINDINGS:</h3>
		<p>According to US census data from 1850, percentage of people in each age group in general during that time
			were 0-10: 28%, 11-20: 25%, 21-40: 30%, 41-60: 13%, 61-80: 4%, > 80: 1%. Here we assume the same for London.
			The largest number of victims were the older people aged greater than 80. The second largest were the kids
			in age range 0-10. Also, the disease was not related to gender as the number of males to the number of
			female victims was relatively insignificant.</p>
